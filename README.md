This repo contains the class FileVersionInfo, works like the same class in .net namespace System.Diagnostics  
The function GetFileVersionInfo is now the constructor  
Works with unicode or ansi, works in VB6 (aka VBC) as well as in VBA (only unicode, as we assume ansi is obsolete in VBA7)  
You may also have a look at the tutorial: [VB-anywhere](https://github.com/OlimilO1402/XL_VBanywhere)  
  
Project started around jan.2007.
